# Crowdfunding DApp

This repository contains a decentralized application (DApp) built for crowdfunding using Solidity, Foundry, Next.js, and wagmi.sh.

## Description

The Crowdfunding DApp allows users to create and participate in crowdfunding campaigns using blockchain technology. It utilizes the Ethereum network and smart contracts written in Solidity to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of the crowdfunding process.

## Features

- Create and manage crowdfunding campaigns
- Contribute funds to campaigns
- Track the progress and status of campaigns
- Withdraw funds when campaign goals are met
- Refund contributors if campaign goals are not met within a specified timeframe

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
- Foundry: A development framework for building decentralized applications.
- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications.
- wagmi.sh: A utility library for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
